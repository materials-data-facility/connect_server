  Scenario: Submit Test Dataset
        Given I'm authenticated with MDF
        And I have a new MDF dataset to submit
        And I mark the dataset as test
        When I submit the dataset
        Then a dynamo record should be created
        And an automate flow started
        And the automate flow will send the files to mdf_connect/test_files
        And I should receive a success result
